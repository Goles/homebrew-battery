homebrew-battery
================

This is the homebrew formula for the [Battery project](http://www.github.com/goles/battery), a nice way to display your MacBook battery status on the terminal/tmux.

You have to add this repository as a `tap` in homebrew, 

    brew tap Goles/battery

After that you can just install battery (and keep it updated) using

    brew install battery

Let me know if you have any suggestions!
